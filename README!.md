# Testing
Throughout the development of this website, regular testing was a priority. Each modification was promptly verified using the Gitpod external server, ensuring the website remained up-to-date and functional. Testing was conducted on a variety of devices, including a 13" MacBook Pro, an iPad Air 2, and an iPhone XS, to guarantee compatibility. Several browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, were utilized during these testing phases.

Interactive elements underwent rigorous testing across all devices to confirm their functionality on different platforms. For instance, the main logo was tested to ensure it reloaded the index.html page correctly, and each navigation bar button was checked to ensure it directed users to the appropriate sections of the site.

The video component was also thoroughly tested on each device, with all controls verified for proper operation. Additionally, the sign-up form was tested to ensure the link opened in a new tab, as intended. The social media icons followed a similar testing protocol, confirming that each one opened in a new tab.

Further testing was conducted by external users. A link to the website was distributed to a list of users who tested it on their own devices. Feedback from these users indicated that the website functioned without any issues.

# Validator Testing

# DELETE BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMISSION

I cropped the hero image as the original was in portrait. When it comes to mobile this would have worked fine but thinking of the browser width that would later come on a computer I decided to have the prepared. I chose this image for its colours and designed the rest of the site with these colours in mind as to keep a consistant theme throughout. 
As it turns out testing of the first image proved that it would not fit neatly across all platforms. As a result a new image was chosen. Sadly this wasted some time as the site until this point had been working towards this colour scheme. Luckily though there were not to many changes to make and a more suitable image was discovered.


**I should add in some sort of hero image effect like the one in boulder dash where the image slides into place**

**Make sure to pass the pages through the validaters**

**Insert screenshots of the finished project in the README**
