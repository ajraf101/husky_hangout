I cropped the hero image as the original was in portrait. When it comes to mobile this would have worked fine but thinking of the browser width that would later come on a computer I decided to have the prepared. I chose this image for its colours and designed the rest of the site with these colours in mind as to keep a consistant theme throughout. 
As it turns out testing of the first image proved that it would not fit neatly across all platforms. As a result a new image was chosen. Sadly this wasted some time as the site until this point had been working towards this colour scheme. Luckily though there were not to many changes to make and a more suitable image was discovered.


**I should add in some sort of hero image effect like the one in boulder dash where the image slides into place**

**Make sure to pass the pages through the validaters**

**Insert screenshots of the finished project in the README**
