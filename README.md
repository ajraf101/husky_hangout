- Features left to implement
  - Online Store: Add an online store selling husky-themed merchandise and pet supplies. This would also support the community.

## Testing

Testing was a key priority throughout development. Each modification was verified using the Gitpod external server to ensure the site remained functional. Tests were conducted on various devices, including a 13" MacBook Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPhone 12 Pro, as well as browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

Interactive elements were rigorously tested across devices. For example, the main logo’s reload functionality and the navigation bar’s accuracy were checked. The video component and sign-up form were tested to confirm proper operation, and social media icons were verified to open in new tabs.

External user testing also confirmed the website’s functionality across different devices.

- Validator Testing
  - HTML: The official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to check the HTML code, and no errors were detected.
  - CSS:The CSS code was validated using the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), which also reported no errors.
  - There was consideration placing the CSS certificate at the bottom of the site, but decided against it as it deteracted from the minimalist style of the page.
